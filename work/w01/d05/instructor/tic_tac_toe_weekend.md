# Tic-Tac-Toe Weekend Project
---

## Objective

Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game incorporating the three web app technologies you've worked with this week:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Minimum Requirements
- Display an empty tic-tac-toe board when the page is initially displayed.
- A player can click on the nine cells to make a move.
- Every click will alternate between marking an `X` and `O`.
- Once occupied with an `X` or `O`, the cell cannot be played again.
- Provide a `Reset Game` button that will clear the contents of the board.

### Getting Started / Hints

- Create an `index.html` page.
- Create and include in your `index.html` page, `style.css` and `script.js` files.
- Start by writing the HTML and CSS that displays a 3x3 grid and the `reset game` button.
- Using `id` and/or `class` attributes will help you wire up your click events with JavaScript.
- Programs, including games, are frequently focused on manipulating data and displaying that data to a user. Decide on the data structures, held in variables, that will maintain the _state_ (data / status) of the game.
- Wire up your click event listener(s). Using a single listener with event bubbling is recommended but not required.
- Put code that needs to run multiple times into functions.

## Bonuses
- Display whose turn it is ("X" or "O").
- Provide win logic and display a winning message.
- Provide logic for a cat's game (tie), also displaying a message.
- Add your personal touch with unique styling.
