## Learning HTML

This lab is very straightforward. Go back and do Dash again, or use your notes
from Dash, to create an HTML cheatsheet in Markdown on your GitHub account. You
can also use the resources in our class 
[Outside Resource list](/resources/outside_resource_list.md).

Add the cheatsheet, named `html.md` to the directory `/resources/cheatsheets`.

Make sure that you use screenshots of how the HTML looks, as well as:

- H1 and H3 headers (`#` and `###`)
- paragraphs
- code blocks with backticks
- lists

Finally, share your cheatsheet with the class by linking to it in Slack when
you're finished. We'll count your homework as complete by checking your links!
