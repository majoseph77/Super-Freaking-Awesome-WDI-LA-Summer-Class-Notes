## Design and Create a `Car`

Design and create a `Car` constructor function for a car object that:

- Has a `make` property
- Has a `model` property
- Has a `year` property
- Has a `color` property
- Has a `mileage` property
- Has a `honk` method that `console.logs` "Beep, beep!".
- Has a `drive` method that will accept an argument of the number of miles to add to the `mileage`. Ensure that the argument is not negative - it's illegal to roll back odometers!

Create several car objects passing in different values as arguments, call their methods and examine their properties.
