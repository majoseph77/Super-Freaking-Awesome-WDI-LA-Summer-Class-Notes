# Js Cheatsheet

- ` var variable_name` : this is how you
declare a variable. Only write it once:
for example, this is bad...

```js
var name= "Pj;"
var name = "Phil";
//should just be: name = "Phil";
```

- strings should use double quotes for
style purposes:

```js
var name= "Phil";
//bad: var name='Phil';
```
