#Phils Schedule

- HW review & emotional cycle

- HTML/CSS exercise

- Procedural program

  -Control structures & flow

  -Logical structures

  -Trees

- Functions

  - 3 paradigms

    1. Proc

    2. Function

    3. Event-driven

  - Using functions

  - Debugging


  ##In class Commands

  1. type `git browse` into terminal to open ur repo in

  2. insert `moo` in console to open up markdowns

  3. `ctrl + C` ends a process (term)

  4.  `ctrl + D` ends an app (term)

  5. `q` can exit (term)

  6. `ctrl + l` clears screen




  ##Lesson Objectives

  - Use CSS selectors that reference the DOM
| If you want your div to have two
classes within one you put both
classes in the div with a space in btween |

- EX: I want a div with the class merlot and pinot
I would write
<div class =" merlot pinot"></div>
this div has 2 classes
this div has 1 class
<div class="merlot-pinot">

##Vocab
1. method: a fx that is the value of some property
of an object


*An object is a datatype that holds several type
of variables. An object holds key values.
An object holds "key" : value
Keys and properties are the same thing
*In order to ask an object for a key we use a .
*EX:If we want our object car to tell us what make
the car is, we would say car.make
It would return benz

*In a constructor function the word "this" refers
to the object that is going to be produced by the
function.

*An array holds a list of things that can be accesed
 by indexes.

#Other names for an object

1. Associative arrays (Js)

2. Object (Js)

3. Hash (ruby)

4. Dictionaries(python)

##Different types of code:
1. Functional code

2. Procedural code

3. Object orientated code

#Lesson Objective

-Define Algorithm

- Define procedural programming and compare it to other
styles of programming

- Event driven program

- Object Orientated programming

- Functional programming

*Algorithm: a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations
or other problem solving operations
especially by a computer

  - A process is a list of steps that must be done in order

  - In an algorithm there is a beginning and an end

  - When were writing in an algorithmic style we are writing in
  procedural programming

*Procedural programming

  -Occurs when you are writing in an algorithmic style.
  -

*Event driven programs are users interfaces. Programs react
to certain events initiated by the user, once those events are called
they are then processed through an algorithm.

#Lesson Objectives
- Define and call functions with argument dependent return values

- Explain the difference between logging output and return values

- Create functions via assignment or declaration.

- Explain what a tree is in CS and where it is used, and name the
parts of a tree: root, branch, leaf, ancestors/ parents,
descendants/children, children.

#Notes
- All conditionals and all loops depend on true ! false
- Always have a space in between if and () Ex: if ()
- Falsey values
1. false
2. ""
3. 0
4. undefined
5. null
6. NaN
- Truthy values
* everything else
- If we are assigning a variable put a ; at the end of }. other than that
 dont.

 -hardcoded means not asking user for input
 - if u ever need order use an array

 - A tree is a data structure. A data structure is a lot of data put together.
- Tree rules

  - first node is called a root

  - when a root takes a nother direction its called a branch

  - any data point that has nothing after it is called a leaf

- algorithms follow the tree format

- you can break down your logic into tree statement

-
