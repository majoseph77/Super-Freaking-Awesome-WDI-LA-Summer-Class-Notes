Explain
Owning your own learning experience

Lesson Objectives:
Abstraction
a simpler , smaller version of something thats very complex
to hide the complexity in some action
Two major ways to hid complexities
remove complexity - modeling
hide complexity - encapsulation

Model
A simplified representation of a complex system, a good model removes unessacary complexity
Problem model
all things needed to be represented in your problem and ways to solve it
Encapsulation
solving a complex problem using modeling, algorithm, and data. Then compressing it so the problem doesn't have to be solved again. To use again an interface is needed
Interfaces
The hidden component of encapsulation that allows one to access the previously solved complexities.
Solve Problem
Wrap it up (encapsulate)
Create simple interfaces
