# WDI DTLA 4 Class Repository

This will be your shared class repo! Cheat sheets, in-class labs and code 
samples, curated lists of articles, and other resources will live here.

### What's in here?

- The **work** directory is where you can put your class work!
- Weekly & Daily directories (**w00/d00**) contain in-class code samples and
  files required for labs and lessons. 
  - Instructors will put their own files in the **instructor** folder. You can
    add yours directly to the daily folder.
- The **resources** directory is where you can find all the extra resources you
  can use to learn about programming! This includes:
  - links to outside articles, blog posts, tutorials, and more ways to extend 
    your learning or read ahead. You can add your own by submitting a pull-request!
  - The **cheatsheets** directory will be your go-to for cheat sheets and 
    procedural instructions (like installs, deployment steps, etc.).
  - The **templates** directory allows you to quickly create a new project 
    using the files and directory structures we discuss in class. Throughout the 
    class, the libraries and best practices we learn will be added to these 
    templates.
  - The **tangents** folder is where you can find suggestions for extra 
    practice -- ideas, prompts, specs, and more. If you need to polish your 
    skills in a given area, you'll want to start here!
- The **projects** directory contains information and resources for class 
  projects.

### What can I do?

As a student, you have **pull** permissions on this repository. We recommend 
maintaining a "pristine" local copy (that you can keep pulling from), and a 
"working" directory (with another name, outside of this directory) that you 
can copy samples into for in-class exercises and labs.

### How do I make a copy?

Before modifying files in the repository, copy them into another folder. To do 
this, you can use the cp command with the -R flag, for example: 
<code>cp -R ~/code/WDI_DTLA_4/resources/templates/html5-template ~/GA/work/w01</code>. 
This will create a new html5-template/ folder inside ~/GA/01-week. 
Including a trailing slash on the source directory will only copy the 
*contents* of the directory. Excluding the trailing slash, as was done in the 
above example, will copy the directory name and its contents.

### What am I viewing here?

You are viewing the README.md file in the current directory. It is written in 
[Markdown] [1] -- a plain text formatting syntax which emphasizes readability. 
It is recommended that you always have a README.md in the root directory of 
your GitHub project. For viewing and editing Markdown files on your 
computer, try [Mou] [2].
